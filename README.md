# React Color Input Application

## Observations

### React State Management
- React's `useState` hook enables functional components to manage state.
- State changes in React are asynchronous and can be batched, optimizing performance.
- Managing form inputs and maintaining their state is straightforward with `useState`.

### Event Handling in React
- React uses a synthetic event system that abstracts away differences in event handling across different browsers.
- Events in React are normalized to have consistent properties, making it easier to work with them.
- Handling user input in React involves creating event handlers that update the component's state, which then triggers a re-render.

## Instructions
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a modern web browser.
3. Type a HEX color code in the input field to see the color preview and validation feedback.

## Setup
- Ensure you have a modern web browser installed (such as Google Chrome, Firefox, or Safari).
- Use any text editor of your choice (VS Code, Sublime Text, Atom, etc.) to view and edit the code.
